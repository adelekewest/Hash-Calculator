# Hash-Calculator
A simple python script used to calculate hashes.

This script uses the hashlib module to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a file or string. To calculate the hash of a file, the script opens the file in binary mode and reads the contents. To calculate the hash of a string, the script encodes the string as bytes. The script then calculates the hash using the sha256() function and prints the result.

To use the script, you can either set the path variable to the path of the file you want to hash, or set the string variable to the string you want to hash. The script will calculate the hash of the file or string and print the result.
